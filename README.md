Task 1 :Build a Calculator CLI App.
This is a simple command-line calculator I built using Python. It's straightforward to use and handles basic math operations that we use every day.

How it works :- 
I created separate functions for each math operation to keep the code organized. The main program runs in a loop, so you can keep doing calculations until you're done. When you choose an operation, it asks for two numbers, does the math, and shows you the result.
